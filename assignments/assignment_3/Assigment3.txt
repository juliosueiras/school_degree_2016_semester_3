In this assignment you need to write class definitions and a main program to simulate
different pricing plans for a cellular telephone provider.
Suppose you work in the marketing department of the GreedyCellular company. Your
boss wants you to compare a proposed plan that offers customers a Basic plan and a
Premium plan. The Premium plan is designed so that customers who make many calls
save money by paying a higher monthly fee.
Write class definitions for Customer and for a derived class PremiumCustomer.
Customer should contain data members common to all customers, like the number of
calls made in a month, the customer’s name, balance and so on.
Also implement a virtual member function for computing a bill, computeBill( ) which
uses the appropriate algorithm and data members to compute a monthly charge for
each type of customer.
In all classes be sure to also include any constructors and other member functions
that you think are needed especially if you use dynamic memory allocation in your
class. The derived class should contain data members and initializations specific to its
payment plan, and a specific implementation for the computeBill() method which
overrides the default method.
In your program you need to create a simulation: make a large population of
customers half of whom use each plan. Use a random number generator to vary the
number of calls from 10 to 100 per month. Also use a random number generator to
vary the number of minutes per call from 1 minute to 4 hours (all the calls are rounded
to an int).
Your program must answer which plan is better for most customers in the simulation.
For the customers who do save with the premium plan you need to indicate the
average savings.
You need to improve addCall() method shown below so it can record phone number
called and date/time of the call. Implement printBill() method that prints detailed call
log.

You can start with the following sample template for the main program:
int main () {
Customer *list[6] ;
list[0] = new Customer("John Smith", 20); // 20 is the initial balance
list[1] = new Customer("Bob Smith", 50);
// list goes on...
list[6] = new PremiumCustomer("Jane Doe", 100);
list[7] = new PremiumCustomer("Mary Doe", 60);

// Add number of calls:
list[0].addCall(51); // call was for 50 minutes
list[0].addCall(23); // call was for 23 mins
list[6].addCall(71);
// more calls added…
for(int i=0; i<6; i++) {
cout << "Customer " << list[i] << " owes "
<< list[i].computeBill() << " dollars." << endl;
}
return 0;
}
Compute the basic Customer’s bill as:
Bill = monthlyfee + (percall × numcalls)
using a monthly fee of $10 and a per call charge of $0.50.
Compute a Premium Customer’s bill as:
Bill = monthlyfee + (percall × numcalls) + (permin × nummins)
using a monthly fee of $20, a per call rate of $0.05, and a per minute call of $0.10
